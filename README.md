# FirebaseNode
### Version 1.7.0
FirebaseNode is framework that provides very easy Api management and connection with Firebase. With the use of FirebaseNode we can connect with firebase and create apis with them very quickly.

## Installation
 * Use npm to install FirebaseNode
    ```bash
    sudo npm i -g firebase-node-cli
    firebase-node-cli new <project_name>
    ```
 * Configure Firebase client and admin.
 * Now use following cmd in root of the project to start server.
   - For Development Mode
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - For Production Mode
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
OR if you clone this repo

 * Use this cmd on root of the project.
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```
 * To setup firebase edit config/firebase.js with firebase-admin and firebase configurations (Both of them are required).
 * For server configuration edit config/server.json.
 * For development run following cmd.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
 * For production run following cmd.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
 * Setup firebase console
    - Sign in to firebase account from [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create new project or use existing.
    - Now in your project deshboard click on web app and register your web app with providing nickname to your app.
    - Now this will show you some SDK code, from that copy firebasConfig and use that as firebase client config.
    - For the admin settings, Go to dashboard click on settings icon near Project Overview link in left sidebar.
        - click on Project Settings
        - Go to Service Accounts
        - Copy node-js config from that and in order to download service account json file click on Generate new private key and use that as service account json file.
 * SetUP Firebase Account in framework config:- 
    - Modify config/firebase.js
        add your firebase client configuration to the key 'firebaseConfig'.
        add your firebase admin configuration to the key 'adminConfig' 
        to add your service account json file at your desired location and require it in this file and replace serviceAccount const with your serviceAccount file data.
 * Create Apis :-
    - Create a folder inside apis folder with the name of api you want.
    - inside that folder create controllers and services folders and routes.json file
    - Format of the routes.json file will be as follows:
        ```JSON
        [{
            "path": "path/to/api",
            "method": "REQUEST_METHOD",
            "action": "CONTROLLER_NAME.ACTION_NAME",
            "secure": true | false,
            "enabled": true | false
        }]
        ```
    - Here we can specify any number of routes we want.
    - If specified action or controllers is not there then that route will be ignored with console warning.
    - Note :- Here path will be prefixed with API_NAME/ACTUAL_PATH
 * Services :- 
    - Services are defined in apis/{API_NAME}/services direcotry.
    - These services will be accessible with framework.services.{API_NAME}.{SERVICE_FILE_NAME}.{FUNCTION_NAME}
 * Controllers :- 
    - Controllers are defined in apis/{API_NAME}/controllers directory.
    - Access services with framework super global variable.
* Middlewares :- 
    - Middlewares are defined in apis/{API_NAME}/middlewares directory.
    - And middlewares can b used in specific route by specifing middlewares: [].
    - Here we need to specify middleware name (file name) and function to execute in string format concatenated by '.'.
* Themes :-
    - Layout, Pages and Prtials can be found in views folder.
    - In order to use or access pages use res.render() method with the path and name of ejs file inside views folder.
      - example : 
      ```JS
      // if file is in root of views folder.
      res.render('filename');
      // if files is inside pages folder.
      res.render('pages/filename');
      ```
    - We can use Partials which can be included in pages.
    - All partials can be found in partials folder.
* Global Functions
    - Global functions are defined in core/functions.js which can be accessed using framework.core.functions.FUNCTION_NAME
    - These functions can be accessed everywhere in this app.
* Defign Paths from root (api routes without merged with api name)
    - Root Api folder is added inside the apis folder here defined all paths will be served from root. (however we can add root maually in the path attribute in order to use that path).
    - Other features will work same as normal apis.
## Changelog
 * Api Routes from Root support added
 * implement themes concept
 * EJS theme engine added.
 * Everything is moved to Functions folder in the root directory.
 * implement array of middlewares
 * Create global app/framework variable to access all controllers/services/firebase/middlewares etc
 * Apis added (All apis which are currently on can be found in apis folder in separated api named folder.)
 * Routes added (Now we'll need to just create routes.json containing routes info to define routes)
 * Controllers added (All actions that a route performs can be referenced and found in controllers folder of each api folder)
 * Firebase config separated from code. (Firebase and firebase admin can be configured from config/firebase.js)
 * Server configuration (server configurations like port number etc can be modified from config/server.json)
 * Firebase admin token middleware is separated from code and can be found at middlewares/firebase_token.js
 * Port checking added (Port will be veryfied before starting server on that port and will ask to start server from another free port without changing the code.)

## TODO
 * Add cli support to create APIs.
 * implement env-cmd package
 * Make One of the Firebase-admin or Firebase optional.
 * implement global middlewares https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html find express.Router
 * Add functions and config to global.
